# FoClocks
FoClocks is a time management app that perfectly combines keep-focus timer, well-organized everyday to-do list, deadline organization, and data record and analysis with a simple and easy-to-operate layout. It includes different types of timers that could satisfy various usersâ€™ preferences and could set different timers for different types of tasks. FoClocks could automatically generate the to-do list for everyday and is able to show the overview of the deadline calendar. The tasks are separated into one-time tasks and everyday tasks and could be set as completed but the data is still archived.
