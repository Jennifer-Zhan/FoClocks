# FoClocks
FoClocks is a time management app that perfectly combines keep-focus timer, well-organized everyday to-do list, deadline organization, and data record and analysis with a simple and easy-to-operate layout. It includes different types of timers that could satisfy various usersâ€™ preferences and could set different timers for different types of tasks. FoClocks could automatically generate the to-do list for everyday and is able to show the overview of the deadline calendar. The tasks are separated into one-time tasks and everyday tasks and could be set as completed but the data is still archived.

# Update
We are currently turning our direction of FoClocks to a more programmer-focus time management app. We created our own instruction set for this app that could easily add, edit, delete tasks, and naviagte our website through typing command line in the console on our webpage. There will be a help alert appear when you click on the help button which could give you some tutorials on how to use our command line.
